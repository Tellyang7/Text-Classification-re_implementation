# Text-Classification-re_implementation Based on word embeddings
This is a simplified version based on the work of "Word-Embeddings-and-Document-Vectors" by ashokc:
> please note: [ashokc/Word-Embeddings-and-Document-Vectors](https://github.com/ashokc/Word-Embeddings-and-Document-Vectors)

As for the reason to reimplement this work, I don't want to pay too much time to learn the structure of "Elastic".

+ I hava cloned the main "pipeline" of the classification task, including the logging setting(and files)
+ Different: delete the parts of "Elasticsearch"

Setup: python Classify.py
